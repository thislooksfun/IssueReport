# IssueReport

This is a small project dedicated to those programmers who are fed up with their users not supplying a crash/error log.  
It is designed to force users to supply vital information, such as the version number, crash log, pictures (if relevant), and steps to reproduce the problem.

If you want to try it out, simply clone this project and open 'form.htm' in any web browser (IE is not recommended, but _should_ still work)
